The Healthcare Diagnosis Expert System is an innovative application designed to assist healthcare professionals and patients in the diagnosis of common medical conditions based on reported symptoms. As the complexity of medical diagnoses continues to increase, there is a growing need for intelligent systems that can provide reliable support in clinical decision-making.

This expert system employs a rule-based approach, leveraging a knowledge base derived from established medical guidelines and expert insights. By allowing users to input symptoms, the system analyzes the information against a set of predefined rules to suggest possible conditions. This not only streamlines the diagnostic process but also enhances the accuracy and efficiency of patient care.

The system serves as a valuable tool for healthcare practitioners, particularly in settings where immediate access to medical expertise may be limited. Additionally, it empowers patients by providing them with preliminary insights into their health conditions, facilitating informed discussions with healthcare providers. Ultimately, the Healthcare Diagnosis Expert System aims to improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce the time required for evaluations, and contribute to better health outcomes.
